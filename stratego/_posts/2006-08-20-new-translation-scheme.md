By a [new translation scheme](http://eelcovisser.org/post/36/getting-rid-of-nested-functions) in the back-end of the Stratego compiler, the dependency on nested functions in gcc has been eliminated. The compiler now produces ANSI C compliant code, increasing the portability of Stratego code in terms of compilers and platforms.
