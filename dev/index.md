# Developing and building MetaBorg components

This section contains documentation on building and developing MetaBorg components.

## Maven

We use Maven as our build system. The [Maven](/dev/maven/) page describes how to set up Maven on your computer, how to use our Maven artifacts, and how to speed up downloading of Maven artifacts.

## Building

The [Build](/dev/build/) page explains how Spoofax, Spoofax languages, and StrategoXT can be built from the command-line.

## Developing

If you'd like to develop changes for Spoofax or any of its components, the [Develop](/dev/develop/) page has details on how to set up a development environment.

## Website

Information on changing the website can be found on the [Website](/dev/website/) page.
