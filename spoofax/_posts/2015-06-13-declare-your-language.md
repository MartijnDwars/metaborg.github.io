[Eelco Visser](http://eelcovisser.org) [announced](http://eelcovisser.org/post/283/Declare+Your+Language+-+A+Spoofax+Book+in+Progress)
that he is writing a book about language definition with Spoofax. Quoting that [post](http://eelcovisser.org/post/283):

> I have started writing a book about declarative language definition with the Spoofax Language Workbench. The first chapter about Getting Spoofax is done. The chapter explains how to get started for Eclipse newbies. In particular, Spoofax is now shipped as a complete Eclipse installation including JRE and the appropriate patches to the 'eclipse.ini' file, so that it should be easy to get started. In the next chapters I will be discussing the definition of a language using Spoofax from a user perspective.

> The project is on GitHub and there's a website with a link to latest version:

> >  <http://metaborgcube.github.io/declare-your-language/>

> The book is a PDF in a format that is intended for reading on tablets (e.g. using the GoodReader app on iPad), i.e. big letters and no margins.

> The source code of the book and of the accompanying Spoofax projects are all in the GitHub repository, so that it is easy to provide contributions, from typo fixes to entire chapters. Pull requests are welcome.
