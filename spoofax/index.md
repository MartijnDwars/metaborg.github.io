Spoofax is a platform for developing textual domain-specific languages with full-featured [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org) editor plugins.
 
With the Spoofax language workbench, you can write the grammar of your language using the high-level SDF  grammar formalism. Based on this grammar, basic editor services such as syntax highlighting and code folding are automatically provided. Using high-level descriptor languages, these services can be customized. More sophisticated services such as error marking and content completion can be specified using rewrite rules in the Stratego language.

## Components

Spoofax is constructed from the following components:

* The SDF syntax definition formalism
* The Stratego transformation language
* The NaBL name binding language
* [IMP](https://github.com/impulse-org)
